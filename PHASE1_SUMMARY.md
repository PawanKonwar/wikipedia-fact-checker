- Works through command line and web browser
- Gives verdicts: TRUE, FALSE, MIXED, or NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE

## Tools Used
- Python 3.12
- Wikipedia API
- Streamlit for web interface
- PyCharm for coding
- GitHub for saving code

## How It Works
1. You type a claim (e.g., "Great Wall is in India")
2. It searches Wikipedia automatically
3. It analyzes the evidence
4. It gives a verdict with proof

## Files Created
- fact_checker.py - Main brain
- app.py - Website version
- requirements.txt - Software needed
- README.md - Instructions
- DEVELOPERS.md - Technical guide

## Learning Achieved
- API integration
- Python programming
- Git and GitHub usage
- Web development basics

## Next Phase: Phase 2
- Add AI intelligence for better understanding
- Improve evidence analysis
- Handle tricky claims better
